# StudySessionsDataCollection


Hello everyone,
Thank you for participating in my pilot study! The goals of this test are to:
Collect data for the pilot study and determine the test's power.
Evaluate the data collection application, noting any issues or conflicts.
My aim is to make this application as user-friendly as possible. Ideally, you’ll be able to run it alongside your coursework or study sessions. Currently, the application isn’t hosted on a Streamlit app or connected to a data store, so please follow these initial steps:
Download this repository.
Run the app.py program, which will open a new window.
Complete a brief questionnaire about your current assignment.
You will be redirected to a stopwatch page. Start the stopwatch when you begin your assignment.
Every 30 minutes, or at your own discretion, please answer the below questions and submit.
Once your session is finished, make sure to end it.
You should find a text file in your downloaded repository. Please submit this file using the form below:

Thank you again for your assistance! If you encounter any issues, don’t hesitate to reach out.
